# Touch Slideshow

Image carousel with 3 different kinds of swipe transitions between images. `Slide-to-next` requires all images to be the same size. `Slide-offscreen` and `card-shuffle` are more suitable for images with different widths.

## Dependencies

* `slide-offscreen` and `card-shuffle` require either jQuery, or a library with a jQuery compatible interface (such as [aQuery](https://github.com/allen-garvey/aquery))

## Getting Started

* Open the index.html files with a touch enabled device, or with Chrome mobile device emulation
